       "[Document(page_content='Speech is a human vocal communication using language. Each language uses phonetic combinations of vowel and consonant sounds that form the sound of its words (that is, all English words sound different from all French words, even if they are the same word, e.g., \"role\" or \"hotel\"), and using those words in their semantic character as words in the lexicon of a language according to the syntactic constraints that govern lexical words\\' function in a sentence. In speaking, speakers perform many different intentional speech acts, e.g., informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing, and can use enunciation, intonation, degrees of loudness, tempo, and other non-representational or paralinguistic aspects of vocalization to convey meaning. In their speech, speakers also unintentionally communicate many aspects of their social position such as sex, age, place of origin (through accent), physical states (alertness and sleepiness, vigor or weakness, health or illness), psychological states (emotions or moods), physico-psychological states (sobriety or drunkenness, normal consciousness and trance states), education or experience, and the like.\\n\\nAlthough people ordinarily use speech in dealing with other persons (or animals), when people swear they do not always mean to communicate anything to anyone, and sometimes in expressing urgent emotions or desires they use speech as a quasi-magical cause, as when they encourage a player in a game to do or warn them not to do something. There are also many situations in which people engage in solitary speech. People talk to themselves sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the use of silent speech in an interior monologue to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self addressing self as though addressing another person. Solo speech can be used to memorize or to test one\\'s memorization of things, and in prayer or in meditation (e.g., the use of a mantra).\\n\\nResearchers study many different aspects of speech: speech production and speech perception of the sounds used in a language, speech repetition, speech errors, the ability to map heard spoken words onto the vocalizations needed to recreate them, which plays a key role in children\\'s enlargement of their vocabulary, and what different areas of the human brain, such as Broca\\'s area and Wernicke\\'s area, underlie speech. Speech is the subject of study for linguistics, cognitive science, communication studies, psychology, computer science, speech pathology, otolaryngology, and acoustics. Speech compares with written language,[1] which may differ in its vocabulary, syntax, and phonetics from the spoken language, a situation called diglossia.\\n\\nThe evolutionary origins of speech are unknown and subject to much debate and speculation.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10. (Image source: Google Blog, 2020)\\nCheck more MIPS algorithms and performance comparison in ann-benchmarks.com.\\nComponent Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

In my high school years I\\nused to read books on NLP, SILVA, Psycho-cybernetics, Mind-mapping, quick calculations, etc. Most\\nof my time was spent reading books and the remaining time was spent impressing friends with my\\nmental abilities. I used to do (so-called) strange things like multiplying three-digit numbers in my\\nmind, memorizing a pack of well shuffled cards, predicting the days on which dates in the century\\nwould fall and so on. These activities were more as a source of entertainment to me than anything\\nelse. In my wildest dreams I had never imagined that one day I would become a faculty on these\\nsubjects.\\nPeople often ask me how I as a college student landed up in this world of Vedic mathematics and\\ntraining people in memory improvement and study skills. Well, honestly speaking, I am not sure\\nmyself exactly when I started these activities — because there was no specific starting point but rather\\na process that evolved.\\nWhen I finished my tenth standard exams, I had a long vacation before college would begin. With\\nthe desire that I do something productive in my days of leisure, my father brought some books for me\\non quick calculations. He knew that I was very good at mental mathematics and so probably he\\nthought that I needed to polish my abilities and some good books would help. I read the books with\\nkeen interest and understood the systems. But as time passed by, I completely forgot about it.\\nAbout a year later, one of our family friends who is the Principal of a school came to my place.\\nShe asked me whether I would do a seminar for her standard ten students on quick calculation and\\nespecially Vedic Mathematics. Obviously, my first reaction was a straight ‘No’ because I was anxious\\nabout addressing an audience. Not that I suffered from stage-fear or anything like that, but the thought\\nof formally teaching a whole group of similarly aged students was not instantly acceptable. The lady\\ndid not try to convince me any further but only said to me, “Think again, you are losing an\\nopportunity.”\\nThe next day I called her up with an affirmative answer. The seminar was arranged after three\\ndays. When I entered the auditorium, I was filled with some skepticism and pessimism as among my\\naudience were students who played cricket with me on weekends and now I had to teach them a\\nsubject which they hated with all their heart!\\nBut, as it is often said, you never know what destiny has in store for you….\\nI vividly remember the two hours of that introductory lecture. As I unfolded the techniques to the\\naudience, I could actually see that they were bedazzled with its workings. As the lecture progressed,\\nthe excitement and enthusiasm increased amongst the crowd and even their mathematics professors\\njoined them. They became deeply engrossed in the lecture and never realized when the two hours had\\npassed by. I received some wonderful feedback from the students. They seemed to be all charged up.\\nAnd believe it or not, one girl actually came and told me that she lost all her fear for mathematics\\nafter attending my lecture. The professors asked me to come once again. All in all, it was indeed the\\nmost memorable experience of my life.\\nThat same night, when I came home I became absolutely thoughtless for a moment. Then I\\npondered over the day’s events and realized that it was not me who deserved the credit for the\\nwonderful feedback that the students gave but it was the system, it was Vedic Mathematics!\\nFrom the very next day, I became sort-of famous in my community with the word spreading', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='around that a very young boy is teaching “magic” in mathematics. Since then, phone calls started\\ncoming from parents, teachers and other schools. I was so overwhelmed with this wonderful response\\nthat I was suddenly filled with a tremendous sense of gratitude towards Vedic mathematics. I thought,\\nsince this science has given me such a lot of happiness and a feeling of self-fulfillment, it is only fair\\nthat I engage in the cause of making it popular and easily accessible to the general public.\\nAnd since then, there has been no looking back….\\nFour years have passed since I gave my first seminar and till date I have conducted hundreds of\\nsessions interacting with thousands of people from all parts of the country. Many leading schools and\\ncolleges have implemented the systems that I teach. The management of these institutions has\\nreported that students have shown praiseworthy improvement in their exam performance after\\nlearning these systems.\\nAs time passed by, I started giving special training to people on topics like ‘how to improve your\\nmemory’ where I taught how to remember dates in history, geographical maps, chemical equations,\\nlong numbers, faces of people, etc.; then there were seminars on study skills, where topics like using\\nthe subconscious mind for study, frequent revision techniques, and the art of writing answers in exams\\nwere discussed.\\nSince most of the content of my seminars was oral, I often received complaints from people that\\nthey failed to retain the techniques in the long run. I was urged to publish my systems in a written\\nformat so that it could be used as a reference work whenever required. They urged me to write a book\\non the techniques that I teach. Thus, out of popular demand I published my first book at the age of 19\\nentitled \\nHow To Top\\n \\nExams & Enjoy Studies\\n.\\nMany readers of my first book wrote to me that they liked the introductory techniques of Vedic\\nMathematics in my book but they wanted to learn the systems in detail. They insisted that I deal with\\nthe subject in a comprehensive manner. Initially, I was a bit skeptical about writing another book\\nwhen I had just published my first. Being a college student, there was a lot of commitment involved in\\nmy mainstream studies, extra-curricular activities and pursuing my professional degrees. Thus, I had\\nto wait for a while before I commenced writing the typescript of this book.\\nMy very first concern when I started writing this book on Vedic mathematics was how should I\\ndeal with the subject. There were tons of books already present in the market and the Internet was also\\nfilled with innumerable research articles on Vedic mathematics. When such a lot of information was\\nalready available, I had to start searching for a strong reason to write another book. Not that I had to\\nprove myself to someone or something like that, but a strong purpose would help me give a focus to\\nthe contents of the book. I would be able to write the book in such a way that it had a certain appeal\\nand meaning to the reader. I was not interested in writing another book on the same subject, but was\\nkeen on giving a strong identity to my book.\\nUpon discussion with other colleagues who teach Vedic Mathematics and on the basis of feedback\\nreceived from the participants of my seminars, I made the following realizations:\\n \\n•\\n Most of the students who wanted to learn Vedic Mathematics were students appearing for\\ncompetitive exams like MBA-CAT, CET, GMAT, UPSC, etc. and they wanted to learn Vedic\\nMathematics so that it would help them crack these exams. They wanted to learn techniques which\\nwould help them solve mathematical problems in the least time possible.\\n•\\n Secondly, many schools had started implementing the methods of Vedic Mathematics in\\nclassroom lectures. They needed a book that would make the entire subject so simple that even an\\naverage student would be able to understand it. The schools wanted a book which would guide\\nbeginners and help them understand the subject right from the basics.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=' \\n \\n \\nVEDIC MATHEMATICS: AN\\nINTRODUCTION\\n \\nYou must have heard of Vedic Mathematics but wondered what this meant and what it was all about.\\nVedic Mathematics is the collective name given to a set of sixteen mathematical formulae\\ndiscovered by Jagadguru Swami Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji Maharaj. Each formula deals with a\\ndifferent branch of Mathematics. These sixteen formulae can be used to solve problems ranging from\\narithmetic to algebra to geometry to conics to calculus. The formulae are complete by themselves and\\napplicable to virtually any kind of mathematical problems. Complex mathematical questions which\\notherwise take numerous steps to solve can be solved with the help of a few steps and in some cases\\nwithout any intermediate steps at all! And these systems are so simple that even people with an\\naverage knowledge of mathematics can easily understand them. Once the formula (which is called\\n‘sutra’ in Vedic Mathematics) is learnt, it can be applied to a certain category of problems, such as\\nmultiplication, division, fractions, and so on.\\nThe founder of Vedic Mathematics, Jagadguru Swami Bharati Krishna Tirthaji Maharaj, was born\\nin 1884. He was an exceptionally brilliant student right from childhood and always secured first place\\nin all his classes throughout his education. He had an extraordinary proficiency over Sanskrit, English,\\nmathematics and other subjects. After having completed his B.A. and M.A., he started writing articles\\non different subjects. Since then much of Swamiji’s life was spent in studying the different spiritual\\nsciences and Vedantic philosophy. He used to go to the nearby forests and practice various forms of\\nmeditation and ponder deeply on these subjects. The formulae (sutras) of Vedic Mathematics were\\ndiscovered by him in the same manner, viz. through deep intuitive meditation.\\nIt is important to note that the word ‘Vedic’ is used as an adjective in connection with the Vedas.\\nWe all know that there are four Vedas: \\nRigveda\\n, \\nSamaveda\\n, \\nYajurveda\\n and \\nAtharvaveda\\n. Each of these\\ndeals with a specific set of subjects. Out of these Vedas, the ‘Atharvaveda’ dealt with subjects of\\narchitecture, engineering and general mathematics. However, according to historians, what we\\ngenerally call Vedic Mathematics in parlance with the findings of Swamiji is not mentioned anywhere\\nin the Vedas, not even the \\nAtharvaveda\\n which deals with mathematical subjects. Then, the obvious\\nquestion arises: Why is the word \\nVedic\\n used to describe this discovery when it has no direct relation\\nwith the Vedas?\\nIn fact, the use of the word \\nVedic\\n as an adjective to the systems of Swamiji has aroused a certain\\namount of controversy. However, the followers and disciples of Swamiji have strong arguments.\\nAccording to Swamiji, the word \\nveda\\n means the fountainhead and illimitable storehouse of all\\nknowledge. This means that the Vedas should have all the knowledge that is needed by a man for his\\nperfect all-round success. Thus, the word \\nVedic\\n was used by Swamiji as an adjective to his discovery.\\nIt is said that Swamiji discovered these Vedic formulae between 1911-1918. I have used the word\\n‘discovered’ because it has a particular significance in the context of Swamiji’s work. Unlike the other\\nsciences, which are discovered empirically, the discovery of Vedic Mathematics is very intuitive.\\nSwamiji did not discover the formulae of Vedic Mathematics by deduction but he discovered them out\\nof deep meditation. It is said that he had practiced meditation in deep silence around the forests of\\nSringeri for a period of eight years, where some higher source of intelligence revealed to him these\\n‘secrets’. Swamiji was a spiritually realized personality and so it was possible for him to gain insights\\nthrough intuitive revelation. Swamiji also told his disciples that he had reconstructed the sixteen', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='formulae from \\nAtharvaveda\\n after tireless research and deep ‘tapas’. Thus, whereas one does not find\\nthe sutras in the \\nAtharvaveda\\n, they were actually reconstructed on the basis of intuitive revelation\\nfrom scattered references of some content of the \\nAtharvaveda\\n.\\nSwamiji had written sixteen manuscripts and each manuscript dealt with each of the sixteen sutras.\\nThese manuscripts were kept by him at the place of one of his disciples. However, the manuscripts\\nwere lost from their place of deposit! There was no other written evidence of the sutras apart from the\\nlost manuscripts. Swamiji was not much disturbed at the loss and said that he could rewrite the whole\\nchunk of research again out of his memory.\\nIn 1957, Swamiji wrote an introductory volume to the sixteen sutras. He planned to write further\\nvolumes but he subsequently developed cataract in both eyes and his failing health did not allow him\\nto fulfill his plans. As time passed his health continued to deteriorate, and in 1960 he achieved\\n‘mahasamadhi’\\n.\\nThus, because of the loss of the manuscripts the world was bereft of great knowledge which it\\nwould have otherwise greatly cherished. What Swamiji has left behind (in comparison to his research)\\nis just the tip of the iceberg. He created the manuscript of his introductory work around 1958 in the\\nUSA and his introductory work has scattered references to the sixteen sutras and sub-sutras.\\nWhatever little matter of Vedic Mathematics is available to us today is of such quality and genius\\nthat it has taken the world by storm, and people have literally been bewildered by the workings of the\\ntechniques. One can only wonder what would have happened to the mathematical world if his\\ncomplete works were accessible to us….\\n ', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Since an early age, their mind is conditioned to believe that maths is boring and\\ndifficult. Thus, it becomes inevitable to create a ‘paradigm shift’ towards the subject. Unless they are\\nexcited about the techniques that will follow, it becomes a Herculean task to arouse enthusiasm\\ntowards the seminar.\\nWith a desire to create a curiosity and yearning for the subject, we researched on a set of\\ntechniques which we call ‘Mental Magic.’ These techniques are so exciting and powerful that they\\nleave the audience bewildered.

For example, the technique of squaring numbers ending with 5 is a specific\\ntechnique because it can be used to square only those numbers that end with 5. It cannot be used to\\nsquare any other type of number. On the other hand, the technique of multiplication as given by the\\nCriss-Cross System is a general technique, as it can be used to multiply numbers of any possible\\ncombination of digits.\\nThus, general techniques have a much wider scope of application than specific techniques because\\nthey deal with a wider range of numbers. In this book, we will give more emphasis to general\\ntechniques as they provide a much wider utility. Chapter 1 deals with the specific techniques; from\\nChapter 2 onwards we will study general techniques.\\n \\nWe will discuss the following techniques in this chapter:\\n(a) Squaring of numbers ending with 5\\n(b) Squaring of numbers between 50-60\\n(c) Multiplication of numbers with a series of 9’s\\n(d) Multiplication of numbers with a series of 1’s\\n(e) Multiplication of numbers with similar digits in the multiplier\\n(f) Subtraction using the rule ‘All from 9 and the last from 10’\\n \\nThe first technique that we will discuss is how to instantly square numbers whose last digit is 5.\\nRemember, squaring is multiplying a number by itself. When we multiply 6 by 6 we get the answer\\n36. This 36 is called the square of 6.\\n \\n(a) Squaring of numbers ending with ‘5’\\n \\nSquaring is multiplying a number by itself.

The square of 105 is\\n11025.\\nSo you can see how simple it is to square numbers ending with a five! In fact, you can mentally\\ncalculate the square of a number ending with a 5. Just multiply the non-five numbers with the next\\nnumber and then multiply the last digits (5 × 5) and add 25 after it.\\n \\nA few more examples are given below:\\nThus we see that the technique holds true in all the examples.\\nThe technique of squaring numbers ending with 5 is a very popular technique. Some educational\\nboards have included it in their curriculum. In Vedic Mathematics, there is an extension to this\\nprinciple which is not known to many people. This formula of Vedic Mathematics tells us that the\\nabove rule is applicable not only to the squaring of numbers ending in 5 but also to the multiplication\\nof numbers whose last digits add to 10 and the remaining digits are the same.\\nThus, there are two conditions necessary for this multiplication. The first condition is that the last\\ndigits should add to 10 and the second condition is that the remaining digits should be the same.\\nLet us have a look at a few examples:\\nIn the above examples, it can be observed that the last digits in each case add up to 10 and the\\nremaining digits are the same. Let us take the first example…\\nHere the last digits are 6 and 4 which add up to 10. Secondly, the remaining digits are the same,\\nviz. ‘6’ and ‘6’.

The knowledge of these characteristics will help us to easily calculate any answer.\\nTo understand the characteristics, we shall carefully observe the steps used in multiplying 2-digit,\\n3-digit and 4-digit numbers. Let us have a look at them:\\nThe steps used for multiplying 2-digit, 3-digit and 4-digit numbers is 3, 5, and 7 respectively. The\\nnumber of steps used for any multiplication can be found using the formula:\\n \\n‘2 multiplied by (number of digits) minus 1’\\n \\nThus, when we multiply 2-digit numbers, the steps used are 2 × 2 – 1 = 3 and therefore we use 3\\nsteps. When we multiply 4-digit numbers, the steps used are 2 × 4 - 1 = 7. When we multiply 5-digit\\nnumbers, the steps used will be 2 × 5 - 1 = 9.\\n(If there are an unequal number of digits in the multiplicand and the multiplier, they should first be\\nmade equal by inserting 0’s at the appropriate places and then the formula must be used.)\\nMost students will be able to guess the trend of the steps used in this system of multiplication by\\nthe mere observation of the examples that we have solved. This is because they follow a systematic\\npattern.\\nThe second characteristic of the Criss-Cross system of multiplication is that the number of steps\\nused will always be an odd number. Amongst these odd number of steps, the first and last steps are\\nmirror images of one another, the second and second-to-last steps are mirror images of one another\\nand so on.\\nIn every case there will be a central step, which will be independent (that is, without any\\ncorresponding mirror image.)\\nFor example, in 2-digit multiplication, steps ‘a’ and ‘c’ are mirror images and step ‘b’ is a central\\nfigure. In 3-digit multiplication, steps ‘a’ and ‘e’ are mirror images, ‘b’ and ‘d’ are mirror images, and', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 39}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='‘c’ is a central figure.\\nIn our daily practice, we mainly deal with small numbers of 2, 3 and 4-digits. Thus, I have given\\nspecial emphasis to them. However, to test whether you have understood the logic of this system, I\\nsuggest that in the empty space provided next, you notate the steps that we will require if we were to\\nmultiply 5-digit numbers. Once you are done, you can check your work with the answer mentioned in\\nAPPENDIX A at the end of the book.\\nDon’t proceed until you have checked the answer in APPENDIX A.\\nMost of you might have made a mistake in step ‘e’ and solved the other steps correctly. If you got\\nall the steps correct then it is indeed praiseworthy. Those who made a mistake in other steps need not\\nget disheartened: with enough practice you shall be able to solve sums effortlessly.\\nI would again like to draw your attention to the trend of the steps used in the multiplication\\nprocedure. Since we are multiplying two five-digit numbers, the number of steps according to the\\nformulae — 2 multiplied by the number of digits minus 1 — will be 9, and thus we have used steps\\nfrom (a) to (i).\\nFurther, you will observe that steps (a) and (i) are mirror-images, steps (b) and (h) are mirror-\\nimages, steps (c) and (g) are mirror images, steps (d) and (f) are mirror images and step (e) is a central\\nfigure.\\nThe Criss-Cross system not only helps us to get answers quickly but also helps us to eliminate all\\nthe intermediate steps used in the multiplication process. This quality of the system can be of\\nimmense aid to students giving various competitive and professional exams.\\n \\nLet us take a hypothetical situation:\\nWe know that in competitive exams, we are given a question with four alternatives out of which\\nwe have to select the correct one.\\n \\n(Q) What is the product of 121 by 302?\\n(a) 36522 (b) 36592 (c) 36542 (d) 36544', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

My answer at this stage is\\n_____2.\\nNext, I cross multiply (2 × 2) and add it to (1 × 0). My final answer is 4.

The idea which I am trying to convey is that while solving any\\nmultiplication problem, the moment you get a part of the answer which is unique to any one of the\\ngiven alternatives, you can instantly mark that alternative as the correct answer.\\nThis advantage is not available with the traditional system as it compels you to do the whole\\nmultiplication procedure with the intermediary steps.\\nThis comparison proves the fact that the urdhva-tiryak sutra (which I call the Criss-Cross system)\\nhelps us to solve any multiplication problem instantly. There are numerous methods in mathematics\\nwhich help you to multiply numbers quickly but most of them can be used only for a particular\\ncategory of numbers, like numbers adding up to 10, numbers between 11 and 20, etc. However, this\\nsystem is a universal system and can be used for any combination of numbers.\\nIn the next page, I have given the steps for multiplying six-digit and seven-digit numbers.

Most school and college exams ask the square roots of perfect squares. Therefore, this\\nchapter is very useful to students giving such exams. Students of higher classes and other researchers\\nwill find the thirteenth chapter useful as they will be able to study the Vedic Mathematics approach to\\ncalculate square roots of any given number — perfect as well as imperfect.\\nThe need to find perfect square roots arises in solving linear equations, quadratic equations and\\nfactorizing equations. Solving square roots is also useful in geometry while dealing with the area,\\nperimeter, etc. of geometric figures. The concepts of this chapter will also be useful in dealing with\\nthe applications of the Theorem of Pythagoras.\\nThe technique of finding square roots of perfect squares is similar to the technique of finding the\\ncube root of perfect cubes. However, the former has an additional step and hence it is discussed after\\nhaving dealt with cube roots.\\n \\nWHAT IS SQUARE ROOT\\n \\nTo understand square roots it will be important to understand what are squares. Squaring of a number\\ncan be defined as multiplying a number by itself. Thus, when we multiply 4 by 4 we are said to have\\n‘squared’ the number four.\\nThe symbol of square is represented by putting a small 2 above the number.\\nFrom the above example we can say that 16 is the square of 4, and 4 is the \\n‘square root’\\n of 16.\\nSimilarly, 25 is the square of 5, and 5 is the \\nsquare-root\\n of 25.\\n \\nMETHOD\\n \\nTo find the square roots it is necessary to be well versed with the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10.\\nThe squares are given below.

Thus, for every number there was a unique corresponding number.\\nHowever in square roots we have more than one possibility for every number\\n. Look at the first\\nrow. Here, we have 1 in the number column and 1 in the square column. Similarly, in the ninth row we\\nhave 1 in the number column and 1 (of 81) in the square column. Thus, if the number ends in 1, the\\nsquare root ends in 1 or 9 (because 1 × 1 is \\none\\n and 9 × 9 is eighty-\\none\\n). Do not worry if you do not\\nfollow this immediately. You may glance at the table below as you read these explanations, then all\\nwill be clear.\\n \\n•\\n Similar to the 1 and 9 relationship, if a number ends in 4 the square root ends in 2 or 8.

The name Base\\nMethod is given by practitioners of Vedic Mathematics in western countries. However, the actual\\nSanskrit sutra as given by Swamiji to define this system is:\\n‘Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah.’ It means ‘all from 9 and the last from 10.’\\nFor all practical purposes, we shall be calling the system elaborated in this chapter as the Nikhilam\\nmethod or simply the ‘Base Method.’\\nThis method is used to multiply numbers. It is of immense help in certain cases where traditional\\nmultiplication takes a long time to calculate the answer. Let us take the case of multiplying the\\nnumber 9999999 by 9999998. If you go by the traditional method it will take a long time to multiply\\nthe numbers and calculate the product. However with the technique described in the Base Method one\\ncan find the answer in less than 5 seconds.\\nThe study of the Base Method is crucial to understand the other formulae of Vedic Mathematics.\\nThere is a corollary of the Base Method which is called the Yavadunam Rule. This sutra is used in\\nsquaring numbers and is discussed in the next chapter.\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n \\nThis system is called the Base Method because in this system we use a certain number as a base. This\\nbase can be any number, but generally we use powers of 10. The powers of 10 include numbers like\\n10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. We select a particular base depending upon the numbers given in the\\nquestion. Suppose we are asked to multiply 97 by 99; in this case the appropriate base would be 100 as\\nboth these numbers are closer to 100. If we are asked to multiply 1005 by 1020 then the appropriate\\nbase would be 1000 as both the numbers are closer to 1000.\\nSecondly, we will find the answer in two parts — the left hand side and the right hand side. The\\nleft hand side will be denoted by the acronym LHS and the right hand side will be denoted by the\\nacronym RHS.\\nLet us have a look at the procedure involved in this technique of multiplication. I have outlined\\nbelow the four steps required in this technique.\\n \\nSTEPS\\n \\n(a) Find the Base and the Difference\\n(b) Number of digits on the RHS = Number of zeros in the base\\n(c) Multiply the differences on the RHS\\n(d) Put the Cross Answer on the LHS\\n \\nThese are the four primary steps that we will use in any given problem.

The powers of 10 are numbers\\nlike 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. In this case since both the numbers are closer to 100 we will take 100 as\\nthe base.\\nSimilarly, in example B both the numbers are closer to 10,000 and so we will take 10,000 as the\\nbase.\\nIn example C, both the numbers are closer to 1,00,00,000 (one crore) and hence we will take one\\ncrore as the base.\\n \\nSo, we have found the bases.\\nWe are still on step A.

In this step we are going to find the answer of the multiplication question in\\ntwo parts, viz. the left hand side or LHS and the right hand side or the RHS. Step B says that the\\nnumber of digits to be filled in the Right Hand Side of the answer should be equal to the number of\\nzeros in the base.\\nIn example A the base 100 has two zeros.

Next, we multiply -250 by -2 and write the\\nanswer as 0500 (converting it into a four-digit number) and putting it on the RHS. Finally, we subtract\\n2 from 9750 and put it on the LHS.

The difference between 1007 and 1000 is (+7) and the\\ndifference between 1010 and 1000 is (+10).\\nNow, since the base 1000 has three zeros, the right hand side will be filled in by a three-digit\\nnumber. We now multiply the differences 10 by 7 and fill the RHS as 070. Finally, we get the cross\\nanswer of 1007 \\nplus\\n 10 as 1017 and put it on the RHS.

In some cases, we\\nmay have one number above the base and the second number below the base. For example, while\\nmultiplying 97 by 103 the difference from the base 100 would be -3 and +3 respectively. In such cases\\nthe above mentioned technique will have to be expanded further.\\nThus, what we have studied so far is just a small part of the base method. We will now study the\\nvarious different combinations of numbers and the technique to be used in each case.\\n \\n \\n(a) When the number of digits in RHS exceeds number of zeros in the base.\\n \\nWe have studied the four steps used in the base method of multiplication. Step B says that the RHS\\nshould be filled by as many digits as the number of zeros in the base. In some cases, the answer on the\\nRHS was small and so we filled the remaining places by inserting zeros. An opposite situation may\\nalso arise when the number of digits on the RHS is more than the number of zeros in the base. In that\\ncase, we will have to carry over as we do in normal multiplication. Have a look at the following\\nexamples:\\n \\n(Q) Multiply 950 by 950\\n•\\n The base is 1000 and the difference is -50.

The digit sum of the question equals to the digit sum of\\nthe answer and hence we can assume that the product is correct.\\n \\nExample 2 (Division)\\n(Q) Verify whether 2308682040 divided by 36524 equals 63210\\nAns: We can use the formula that we had learnt in school.\\nDividend = Divisor x Quotient + Remainder.\\nIn this case we will be using the same formula but instead of the actual answers we will be using\\ntheir digitsums\\nThe digit-sum of Dividend is 6.\\nThe digit sum of divisor, quotient and remainder is 2, 3, and 0 respectively.\\nSince 6 = 2 × 3 + 0, we can assume our answer to be correct.\\nIn this manner, we can solve sums involving other operations too. However, before continuing\\nahead I will introduce a further short-cut to this method. The rule says:\\nWhile calculating the digit-sum of a number, you can eliminate all the nines and all the digits that\\nadd up to nine.\\nWhen you eliminate all the nines and all the digits that add up to nine you will be able to calculate\\nthe digit-sum of any number much faster. The elimination will have no effect on the final result.\\n \\nLet us take an example:\\n \\n(Q). Find the digit-sum of 637281995\\nAns: The digit sum of 6372819923 is:\\n6+3+7+2+8+1+9+9+2+3 = 50 and again 5+0 is 5.', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",

Hence, it is proved that we can use the\\nshort-cut method for calculating the digit-sum. The answer will be the same in either case.\\nA few more examples:\\nFrom the above table we can see that the values in column ‘b’ and the values in column ‘d’ are\\nsimilar.\\nNote: If the digit-sum of a number is 9, then we can eliminate the 9 straight away and the digit-\\nsum becomes ‘zero.’\\n \\nExample 3 (Multiplication)\\n(Q).

For example, in a three by three grid, the centre-\\nmost number is 5 and the number of squares on any one side is 3. When 5 is multiplied by 3 the\\nanswer is 15 and hence the total of any side is always 15.

When 9 is divided by 2 the answer is\\n4.5 and when 4.5 is rounded off to the next higher number the answer is 5. Hence, the centre-most\\nsquare in a three-by-three grid will be occupied by the number 5.\\nExample 2: A five-by-five grid will have 25 squares and so the maximum number will be 25.\\nWhen 25 is divided by 2 the answer is 12.5 and when 12.5 is rounded off the answer is 13. Hence,\\nthe number that will appear in the centre-most square of a five-by-five grid will be 13.\\n(e) Combining properties (c) and (d), we can find the total of a side of any magic square. Suppose\\nyou want to find out what will be the total of any side of a seven-by seven grid.\\nWe know that there are 49 squares in a seven-by-seven grid and hence the highest number is 49. 49\\ndivided by 2 and rounded off gives 25. Hence, the centre-most square will be occupied by the\\nnumber 25. Next we want to find the total of any side. We multiply the number in the centre-most\\nsquare by the number of squares in any side. In this case, the answer will be 25 multiplied by 7\\nwhich is 175. Hence, the total of any side of a seven-by seven grid will be 175.\\nOn similar lines, it can be proved that the total of any side of a nine-by-nine grid will be 81 divided\\nby 2 and rounded off which is 41 and then 41 multiplied by 9 which is 369.\\n(f) There are four possible ways by which a magic square can be made out of a certain grid.

Hence, if it is Thursday this year, then it\\nwill become Friday next year. However, when a leap year occurs then a date moves two days later.\\nThus, if it is a Thursday this year and the next year is a leap year, then it will move two steps ahead\\nand become a Saturday. This phenomenon takes place because the extra day of the leap year pushes\\nthe date a further step ahead. Hence, instead of taking a regular one-step ahead, it takes two steps.\\n \\nExample:\\n8 July 2005 is a Friday. In 2006, it will move a step ahead and occur on a Saturday. In 2007, it will\\noccur on a Sunday. In 2008, (which is a leap year) it will move two steps ahead and occur on a\\nTuesday.

We have seen a system in this chapter by which you can find the day\\non which any date falls for this century only.

It will fall on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in the years\\n2001, 2002 and 2003 respectively. In 2004, it will become a Friday. Hence, on 2nd January 2005 (2\\ndays later) it will be a Sunday.\\n \\n(Q) If 17th July 2010 is a Sunday, then what day will it be on 17th July 2007 ?\\nAns: In this sum we have to do backward calculation. We are given that 17th July 2010 is a\\nSunday. Thus, we move one step behind and find that in 2009, it was a Saturday. In 2008 it was a\\nFriday. And in 2007 we move two steps behind and find that it was a Wednesday. (As per rule B, a\\ndate moves two steps ahead in a leap year. Hence, we have to go two steps back from a leap year when\\nwe are going backwards.)\\n \\n(Q) If 1st January 2099 is a Thursday, what day will it be on 1st January 2101?\\nAns: We are given that 1st January 2099 is a Thursday. The next year 2100 is not a leap year as the\\nfirst two digits are not divisible by 4. Hence, the date will move one step ahead only and become a\\nFriday.

Try to find a perfect square just smaller\\nto 5. A perfect square just smaller to 5 is 4 and is obtained by multiplying (2 × 2).

Cubing can be defined as multiplying a\\nnumber by itself and again by itself. Thus 3 × 3 × 3 is 27 and thus 27 is the cube of 3. When we cube a\\nnumber we are said to have raised it to the power of 3. The cube of a number is expressed by putting a\\nsmall three on the top right part of the number. For example,\\nCubing is important while dealing with some algebraic equations and also while dealing with\\nthree-dimensional figures in geometry.\\nIn this chapter we will study two methods of cubing numbers. Once you are well versed with all\\nthree systems, then you can decide which system to use depending on the question that you are dealing\\nwith.\\n \\nMETHOD ONE: FORMULA METHOD\\n \\nThe formula method of cubing is the first method taught to students. We have all learnt this system\\nwhen we were in school. The cube of any number can be found out using the formulae:\\nUsing this formulae, we were asked to express any given number as a sum or a difference of two\\nnumbers and then find its square.\\n \\nQ. Find the cube of 102\\nWe know that 102 is (100 + 2). We express the cube of 102 in the form of (100 + 2) where the\\nvalues of a and b are 100 and 2 respectively.\\nQ. Find the cube of 97\\nThe cube of 97 can be expressed as (100 - 3)\\n3\\n.\\nThe formula method is of the simplest and most straight forward methods of cubing a number.

Institutions\\nwhich have invited me to conduct seminars on this subject have invited me again and again to conduct\\nmore sessions and to address larger audiences. Many institutions providing training in competitive\\nexams to students have made teaching of Vedic Mathematics compulsory. There is literally a craze in\\nthe student community to learn these systems.\\nWhereas these systems are being taught informally to the students of schools and colleges, there\\nhas been rising pressure to introduce these systems formally as a part of the school and college\\ncurriculum. Many people ask me why schools and colleges don’t officially conduct training programs\\non this subject. If these subjects are being taught formally, then it will be easy to address larger\\naudiences and ensure that the subjects are thoroughly learnt.\\nMany universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and other western\\ncountries have increasingly encouraged further research on these systems. They have employed\\nfaculties and trainers who regularly teach students. Everyday I hear news of some educational\\ninstitution in the west which has formally accepted the study of Vedic Mathematics in its curriculum.\\nHowever, the sad thing is that our own people have the greatest resentment against the system.\\nWhatever little criticism that this subject has faced, due to whatever reasons, has been from Indians\\nrather than outsiders.\\nI do not want to sound too critical but one of the greatest problems with our culture is that we do\\nnot accept the treasures that lie with us, and when the same treasures are imported from the west we\\nembrace them with open arms.\\nWhen Yoga had prominence only in India, not many people felt the desire to practice it. But when\\nthe western world and the celebrities of the west started showing interest in Yoga even we wanted to\\nlearn it.\\nThis is not a recent phenomenon. This has happened with almost all of our spiritual and ancient\\nsciences. The philosophy of the Buddha has been accepted more by the other countries of Asia than\\nIndia. Ancient practices of Zen religion were not readily accepted by people here, but when an\\nAmerican author wrote a book by the name of \\nZEN and the Art of Motorcycle\\n \\nMaintenance\\n, it became\\na bestseller in India!\\nAt this juncture, I am precisely concerned about the same thing. Vedic Mathematics is getting a\\nred-carpet welcome from the educational circles in the west whilst many people in its country of\\norigin are not much interested in teaching and making it popular.\\nAs the author of this book and as one of the world’s youngest faculties on this subject, it is my\\nsincerest desire that we realize the value and greatness of a science which has been discovered by one\\nof our fellow countrymen.\\nOtherwise, as it has always happened with ancient sciences, the west will realize its importance\\nmuch ahead of us and put it to practice, and we shall only welcome it many years later through their\\nchannels….\\n \\n* * * * * * * * * *', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",

Right from high\\nschool students to those appearing for competitive exams to engineers, everybody deals with this\\ntheorem as a part of their daily practice. The concept that we will study in this Appendix is not only\\nuseful for calculating Pythagorean triplets but also useful in the Apollonius theorem, co-ordinate\\ngeometry and trigonometric identities like sin\\n2\\nØ + cos\\n2\\nØ = 1.\\nWe know that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the\\nsquares of the other two sides. For example, if the sides of the right-angled triangle are 3, 4 and 5 then\\nthe square of 5 equals the square of 3 plus the square of 4. The values 3, 4 and 5 together form a\\nPythagorean triplet. Other examples of triplets are (6-8-10), (9-40-41), (11- 60-61), etc. We are going\\nto study a method by which we can form triplets out of a given value. This technique will be of great\\nhelp to students dealing with geometric figures in competitive exams.\\nWe will divide our study into two parts. In the first part, we will express the square of a number as\\nthe sum of two squared numbers. In the second part, we will express a given number as the difference\\nof two squared numbers. The first part is further divided into two cases — the first case dealing with\\nodd numbers and the second dealing with even numbers.\\n \\n(A) Expressing the square of a number as the sum of two squared numbers\\n \\nCase 1: Odd Numbers\\n \\nRule: The square of an odd number is also odd. This square is the sum of two consecutive middle\\ndigits.\\n \\nExample:\\n(a) 3\\n2\\n = 9 = 4 + 5\\n(b) 5\\n2\\n = 25 = 12 + 13\\n(c) 9\\n2\\n = 81 = 40 + 41\\n \\nWe see that the square of 3 (odd) is 9 (odd), which is the sum of two consecutive numbers, viz. 4\\nand 5. Similarly, 25 is the sum of two consecutive numbers, 12 and 13.\\nBut how do we find the consecutive numbers? The answer is very simple. To find the consecutive\\nnumbers, just divide the square by 2 and round it off.\\nIn the first example, the square of 3 is 9. When 9 is divided by 2 the answer is 4.5. When 4.5 is\\nrounded off to its next higher and lower numbers we have 4 and 5! Thus, (3-4-5) form a triplet where\\nthe square of the highest number is equal to the sum of the square of the other two numbers.\\nIn the second example, the square of 5 is 25. When 25 is divided by 2 we get 12.5. When 12.5 is\\nrounded off to its next higher and lower numbers, we have 12 and 13. Thus, (5-12-13) form a triplet\\nwhere the square of 13 equals the square of 5 plus the square of 12.\\nIn the last example, the square of 9 is 81. When 81 is divided by 2 and rounded off it gives 40 and\\n41. Thus, (9-40-41) is a triplet where the square of the biggest number (41) is equal to the sum of the\\nsquare of the other two numbers (9 and 40).\\n ', metadata={'source': 'Vedic_Mathematics.pdf', 'page': 150}),\n",

Therefore, we cannot have two middle digits on\\ndividing it by 2. Thus, we divide the even number by 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. (powers of 2) until we get an odd\\nnumber. Once we get an odd number we continue the procedure as done in the case of odd numbers.\\nIf you have divided the even number by 2, 4, 8, etc. the final answer will have to be multiplied by\\nthe same number to get the triplet.\\n \\nQ. One value of a Pythagorean triplet is 6; find the other two values.\\nWe divide 6 by 2 to get an odd number 3. Next, we follow the same procedure as explained in the\\ncase of odd numbers to form a triplet (3-4-5). Now, since we have divided the number by 2 we\\nmultiply all the values of (3-4-5) by 2 to form the triplet (6-8-10).\\nThus, the other two values are 8 and 10.\\n \\nQ. One value of a triplet is 20; find the other two values.\\nWe divide 20 by 4 to get an odd number 5. Next, we follow the same procedure as explained before\\nto form a triplet (5-12- 13). Now, since we have divided the number by 4, we multiply all values of the\\ntriplet (5-12-13) by 4 and make it (20-48-52).\\n \\nThus the other two values are 48 and 52\\n \\n(B) Expressing a given number as a difference of two squares\\n \\nWe express a given number ‘n’ as a product of two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’ and then express it as:\\nn = [(a + b)/2]\\n2\\n - [(a - b)/2]\\n2\\n \\nQ. Express 15 as a difference of two squared numbers.\\nWe know that 15 = 5 x 3. Thus, the value of ‘a’ is 5 and ‘b’ is 3.\\nFrom the above, it can be proved that if one side of the triangle is √15 then the other side is 1 unit\\nand the hypotenuse is 4 units. This can be checked with the expression (√15 )\\n2\\n + 1\\n2\\n = 4\\n2\\n.\\n \\nQ. In ∆ABC, the value of side angle B is 90 degrees and side BC is 6 units.

What is Vedic Mathematics?\\nVedic Mathematics is the name given to a set of wordformulae as invented by Jagadguru Bharati\\nKrishna Maharaj. The formulae contain secrets of quick calculation and solving mathematical\\nproblems mentally.\\n \\nQ. Is it taken from the Vedas?\\nAs such, the science is not taken from the Vedas. It is an original endeavour of the author.\\nHowever, the appendices to the Atharvaveda contain some parallel references.\\n \\nQ. What is the best age to start teaching it?\\nThe techniques of Vedic Mathematics are not accepted by the normal school systems. Using Vedic\\nMathematics, the answer to a particular problem is obtained directly without any intermediary steps.\\nHowever, students are given marks for showing the intermediary steps and the calculation procedure\\ninvolved in solving a particular problem. Hence, any particular Vedic technique should be taught to a\\nstudent only after he has mastered the traditional way (the method taught in school).\\n \\nExample: A third standard student is expected to show the complete steps while solving a\\nmultiplication problem. The teacher will give him full marks after carefully observing all the steps.\\nHowever, a fifth or a sixth grade student is not required to show all the steps while solving a\\nmultiplication problem. If his final answer is correct, the teacher may well award him full marks.\\nThus, there is no ideal age as such. However, most concepts of Vedic Mathematics will be best\\nunderstood by high school and college students.\\n \\nQ. How is VM different from the abacus technique of calculation?\\nThe abacus system of calculation is Chinese whilst VM is Indian. Secondly, the abacus system\\ndeals with arithmetic only and hence it is taught to students of the age group of 5-13 years. On the\\nother hand, VM not only covers arithmetic but also algebra, geometry, calculus and other advanced\\nbranches of mathematics. Hence, it is suitable for students of any age.\\n \\nQ.
